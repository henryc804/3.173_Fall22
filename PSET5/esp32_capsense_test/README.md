## Example code
This library is a slightly modified version of the CapacitiveSensor library [https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor] so it can compile on the Adafruit Feather V2 for MIT's 3.173 class.

You can use the examples from the CapacitiveSensor documentation, but just make sure you change the included library to be ```#include <ESP_CapSense.h>``` instead.
